# ML & AI Projects Portfolio – Pragyan Prayas Jena

This repository showcases my end-to-end projects in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and full-stack AI development. Each project covers the complete pipeline — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using Flask and web interfaces.

## Projects

### Breast Cancer Detection
Supervised machine learning model for early breast cancer classification. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

### LLM Document Chatbot
Conversational application that answers queries from uploaded PDF, Word, and Excel files. Built using open-source LLMs with Ollama, LangChain, and LlamaIndex, integrated into a full-stack Flask interface.

### Cat vs Dog Classifier
Image classification web application using multiple machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) with a user-friendly Flask interface.
